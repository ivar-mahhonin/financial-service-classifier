This project uses machine learning to classify support tickets for a financial service. 

The model is trained on a dataset of support tickets, each with a label indicating the type of issue the ticket represents (such as an "bank account services" or "Mortgages/loans"). 

Given a new support ticket, the model is able to predict the correct label, allowing the service desk to efficiently route the ticket to the appropriate team for resolution.
